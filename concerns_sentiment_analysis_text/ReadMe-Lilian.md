Could you please provide me with the API format, including the output parameters you require? 

Once I have this information, I'll adjust my code accordingly to meet your specifications. Additionally, if there are specific requirements regarding code integration or smoke testing, please let me know the basic workflow on your end, or share any details so that I can collaborate effectively with you.

- The input parameter to feed models here is the "user_inputs" text.
- Out parameters: labeled concern after classification, some mode evaluation metrics （TBD based on the API requirements）
