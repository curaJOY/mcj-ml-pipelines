Example:
Once upon a time, there was a fictional character named Alex who wanted to improve their ability to be mindful of their facial reactions to other kids' behavior. Alex knew that sometimes their face would involuntarily show disapproval or frustration, even if they didn't mean to. So, they decided to try out some steps to help them be more aware and intentional with their facial expressions.

One day, during recess, Alex noticed their friend Emma being excluded from a game by a group of kids. They could feel their own frustration rising, but they remembered the first step: taking a deep breath and centering themselves. Alex closed their eyes briefly, taking a moment to calm their emotions before responding.

Next, Alex reminded themselves to be mindful and aware of their facial expressions. They knew that their face could give away their true feelings, so they wanted to make sure they were intentional about it. They focused on the present moment and brought their attention to their face, ensuring they were fully present and aware of their expressions.

As Alex observed the situation, they noticed the sadness in Emma's eyes, and they felt a surge of empathy. They acknowledged the emotions they were experiencing in response to the behavior, remembering the third step.

"Block out extra transition time between activities, so I arrive on-time.",Plan better (time management),Executive Functioning Skills,Procrastinating,,"Steps:
Step 1: Before starting your day, make a list of all the activities you need to complete and the time you estimate each activity will take.

Step 2: Calculate how much extra transition time you will need between each activity. This is the time you need to move from one activity to another without feeling rushed. As a rule of thumb, add 5-10 minutes of transition time for each activity.

Step 3: Set an alarm or timer for the transition time you calculated in step 2. For example, if you estimate that you need 5 minutes of transition time between activities, set an alarm for 5 minutes before the end of each activity.

Step 4: When the alarm goes off, finish up any loose ends in your current activity and start preparing for the next one. This might involve gathering materials, putting away your current activity, or mentally transitioning to the next task.

Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each transition between activities throughout your day. By consistently blocking out extra transition time and using alarms to remind you, you'll be able to smoothly move from one activity to another and arrive on-time.

Example:
Emma, a sixth-grader, wanted to make sure she arrived on time for all her activities throughout the day. She knew that rushing from one activity to another often made her feel stressed and overwhelmed. So, she decided to try blocking out extra transition time between activities.

In the morning, Emma made a list of all her activities and estimated how long each one would take. She realized that she often underestimated the time it would take to transition between activities. To account for this, she decided to add 5 minutes of transition time for each activity.

As she started her day, Emma set an alarm on her phone for the transition time she calculated. For example, if she estimated that she needed 5 minutes to transition from math class to lunch, she set an alarm for 5 minutes before lunchtime.

When the alarm went off, Emma finished up her math work, packed her materials, and mentally prepared for lunch. She didn't feel rushed or stressed because she had planned for this transition time. She smoothly moved from one activity to another.

Throughout the day, Emma repeated this process for each transition between activities. By blocking out extra transition time and using alarms as reminders, she found that she arrived on time without feeling overwhelmed. She was able to enjoy each activity fully and have a more positive and balanced day.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Step 1: Choose a decision to research and make a pros and cons list about. It could be something like deciding which extracurricular activity to join, which elective to take, or even which pet to get.

Step 2: Start by gathering information about your decision. Use books, websites, or ask people who have experience or knowledge about the topic. Take notes on the positive and negative aspects of each option.

Step 3: Create a pros and cons list. Draw a line down the center of a piece of paper or use a table in a Word document. On one side, write down all the positive aspects (pros) of each option. On the other side, write down all the negative aspects (cons). Be honest and list as many points as you can think of.

Step 4: Evaluate the pros and cons. Look at each point and consider how important it is to you. Some pros or cons may be more significant than others. For example, if you're deciding on an extracurricular activity, a pro might be that it aligns with your interests, while a con might be that it conflicts with your schedule.

Step 5: Make your decision based on the pros and cons list. After carefully considering all the information, weigh the positives against the negatives. You might find that one option clearly stands out as the better choice, or you might realize that the pros and cons are evenly balanced.

After much contemplation, Alex made their decision. They realized that while they loved music, soccer was their true passion. They enjoyed the camaraderie of being on a team and the thrill of playing in competitive matches. With confidence, Alex decided to try out for the soccer team and pursue their love for the sport.

get fast food only once a week,"Healthy relationship with food,Lose weight.  Build Lean Muscles.",Declining physical health,,,"Steps:
Step 1: Understand the importance of limiting fast food intake. Fast food may taste good, but it is often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and sodium. Eating fast food frequently can lead to weight gain, heart problems, and other health issues. By only having fast food once a week, you can enjoy it as a treat while still maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Step 2: Plan your fast food day. Choose a specific day of the week when you will allow yourself to have fast food. It could be a day when you have less time for cooking or a day when you want to treat yourself. Make sure you stick to this day and avoid having fast food on other days.

Step 3: Be mindful of your fast food choices. When you do go to a fast food restaurant, try to make healthier choices. Look for options that include more vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid sugary drinks and opt for water or unsweetened beverages instead. Remember, making small changes to your fast food choices can make a big difference in your health.

Step 4: Practice portion control. Fast food portions are often larger than what our bodies actually need. Be mindful of the serving sizes and try to eat smaller portions. You can share a meal with a friend or family member, or save half for later. By being aware of your portion sizes, you can still enjoy fast food without overeating.

Step 5: Find healthier alternatives. Instead of relying solely on fast food for convenience, try to find healthier alternatives that you can enjoy during the week. Plan and prepare simple meals in advance that are quick to make. You can also keep healthy snacks on hand, like fruits, vegetables, or nuts, for when you need a quick bite.

Example:
Meet Sarah, a sixth-grader who loves the taste of fast food but knows it's important to limit her intake. She understands that eating fast food too frequently can have negative effects on her health. 

Sarah decides to follow the steps to have fast food only once a week. She starts by planning her fast food day, which she chooses to be Fridays. This way, she can end the school week with a treat. 

On her chosen Friday, Sarah heads to her favorite fast food restaurant. She remembers the importance of making healthier choices, so she decides to order a grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad instead of a burger and fries. She also opts for a bottle of water instead of a sugary soda.

As Sarah enjoys her meal, she practices portion control. She eats half of her sandwich and saves the other half for later. This way, she can savor the taste of fast food without overeating. 

Throughout the week, Sarah makes sure to plan and prepare simple meals at home, so she doesn't feel the need to rely on fast food for convenience. She keeps a variety of fruits, vegetables, and nuts as healthy snack options, which she enjoys when she needs a quick bite.

By following these steps, Sarah successfully limits her fast food intake to once a week. She enjoys her fast food day as a special treat while still maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Way to go, Sarah!",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Step 1: Take a deep breath and count to 10. This will help you calm down and think more clearly before reacting to a potentially difficult situation.

Step 2: Assess the situation. Ask yourself if getting into a fight is really worth it. Is it something that can be resolved peacefully? Is there an adult nearby who can help?

Step 3: If there is an adult present, approach them calmly and explain the situation. Ask for their assistance in resolving the conflict or getting away from it.

Step 4: If there is no adult around or if you feel unsafe, choose to walk away. Remove yourself from the situation and find a safe place where you can gather your thoughts and emotions.

Step 3: Practice empathy by putting yourself in the other person's shoes. Try to understand their thoughts and feelings, and respond in a supportive and understanding manner. Show that you care about their perspective and validate their emotions.

Step 4: Be mindful of your nonverbal communication. Pay attention to your body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. Make sure they align with the message you want to convey. For instance, if you are trying to show excitement, smile and use an enthusiastic tone of voice.

Step 5: Practice assertiveness by expressing your thoughts and feelings in a clear and respectful manner. Use ""I"" statements to communicate your needs and preferences, while still being considerate of others. For example, instead of saying, ""You never listen to me,"" say, ""I feel frustrated when I don't feel heard.""

Example:
Meet Sarah, a sixth-grader who wants to improve her communication skills. She starts by actively listening to her friends during conversations. When her friend Emily tells her about her soccer game, Sarah looks at Emily, nods her head, and smiles to show that she is interested and paying attention.

Sarah also uses open-ended questions to encourage more meaningful conversations. When her friend Jason talks about his weekend, Sarah asks, ""What was the most exciting thing you did?"" This allows Jason to share more details about his weekend adventures.

During a disagreement with her sister, Sarah practices empathy. She tries to understand her sister's perspective and says, ""I can see why you might feel that way. It must be frustrating for you."" This helps her sister feel heard and understood.

Sarah is mindful of her nonverbal communication as well. When her teacher praises her for a good job on a project, she smiles and says, ""Thank you!"" with enthusiasm. Her body language and tone of voice convey her genuine appreciation.

Lastly, Sarah practices assertiveness by expressing her thoughts and feelings respectfully. When a classmate accidentally takes her pencil, she calmly says, ""I noticed you have my pencil. Could I please have it back? It's important to me."" This allows her to communicate her needs without being confrontational.

Through these steps, Sarah improves her communication skills and enjoys more meaningful conversations with her friends and family. She feels more confident expressing herself and understanding others.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Keep my thoughts to myself,,"Self-Regulation and Coping,Poor Marriage",Putting others down,,"Steps:
Step 1: Recognize the thoughts: Before you can keep your thoughts to yourself, it's important to be aware of what thoughts are going through your mind. Pay attention to your thoughts and notice when they start to come up.

Step 2: Evaluate the thoughts: Once you recognize your thoughts, take a moment to evaluate them. Are they helpful or unhelpful? Are they positive or negative? Determine if sharing these thoughts out loud would be beneficial or if it would be better to keep them to yourself.

Step 3: Take a breath: If you find that the thoughts you have are better left unsaid, take a deep breath to help calm yourself. Deep breathing can help you relax and gain control over your thoughts, making it easier to keep them to yourself.

Step 4: Find a distraction: If you're struggling to keep your thoughts to yourself, find a distraction to shift your focus. Engage in a task or activity that you enjoy, such as reading a book, playing a game, or doing a puzzle. This can help redirect your thoughts and keep them from being shared.

Step 5: Practice self-reflection: After successfully keeping your thoughts to yourself, take some time to reflect on the experience. Think about why it was important to keep those thoughts private and how it benefited you and others. This self-reflection will help reinforce the habit of keeping your thoughts to yourself in the future.

4. Take your time to carefully observe and study each picture. Pay attention to the details, colors, and shapes.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have looked at a total of 10 pictures of the thing you're afraid of.

Example:
Once upon a time, there was a sixth-grader named Alex who had a fear of spiders. Alex knew that facing fears can be helpful, so they decided to carry out an activity to look up 10 pictures of spiders.

Alex sat down at their computer and opened up their web browser. They typed in the search engine, ""pictures of spiders,"" and anxiously hit enter. A list of search results appeared on the screen, and Alex clicked on the first website that showed pictures of spiders.

As they scrolled through the website, Alex felt a mixture of curiosity and fear. They looked closely at each picture, noticing the different colors and shapes of the spiders. Some were big and hairy, while others were small and colorful. Alex took a deep breath and reminded themselves that these were just pictures and couldn't harm them.

After carefully observing the first set of pictures, Alex went back to the search results and clicked on another link. This time, they saw pictures of spiders in different environments like forests and deserts. Alex found it interesting how spiders could adapt to different habitats.

They continued this process, exploring different websites and looking at various pictures of spiders. With each picture, Alex felt their fear gradually lessen. They realized that spiders were fascinating creatures, even if they still felt a bit scared.

Finally, after viewing a total of 10 pictures, Alex closed the web browser. They felt a sense of accomplishment and knew that facing their fear was a step towards overcoming it. They decided to repeat this activity in the future to further desensitize themselves to spiders.

Remember, it's important to go at your own pace and take breaks if you need to. Facing fears can be challenging, but with time and practice, it can become easier.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Meditate or practice mindfulness.,De-stress and build my calming strategies,Self-Regulation and Coping,,,"Steps:
Step 1: Find a quiet and comfortable space - Choose a calm and quiet place where you won't be easily distracted. It could be your bedroom, a cozy corner in your house, or even outside in nature.

Step 2: Get into a comfortable position - Sit or lie down in a way that feels comfortable for you. You can sit cross-legged on the floor, lie down on your back, or even sit on a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Close your eyes gently or keep them softly focused on a spot in front of you.

Step 3: Take deep breaths - Start by taking a deep breath in through your nose, filling your belly with air. Then slowly exhale through your mouth, letting go of any tension or stress. Repeat this a few times, focusing on your breath and the sensation of it entering and leaving your body.

Step 4: Bring your attention to the present moment - As you continue breathing, notice the thoughts and feelings that come up in your mind. Instead of getting caught up in them, imagine them like passing clouds in the sky. Let them come and go, without judgment or attachment.

Step 5: Stay in the present - Shift your focus to your senses. Notice the sounds around you, the feeling of your body against the surface you're sitting or lying on, and any smells or tastes that you can detect. Keep your attention on these sensations, grounding yourself in the present moment.

Example:
Emily found a quiet spot in her room, away from the noise of her siblings playing downstairs. She closed her bedroom door gently and sat cross-legged on her fluffy rug. Taking a deep breath in through her nose, she felt her belly rise as she filled it with air. Slowly exhaling through her mouth, she imagined all the stress and worries leaving her body with each breath. She continued this pattern a few more times, feeling her body relax with every exhale.

As she focused on her breath, Emily noticed thoughts popping up in her mind. She imagined them as fluffy white clouds passing by in the sky, not holding onto any of them. Instead, she gently let them go, redirecting her attention back to her breath. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

After a few minutes, Emily shifted her awareness to her senses. She listened to the distant sound of birds chirping outside her window, the soft hum of the air conditioning, and the muffled laughter from downstairs. She felt the softness of the rug beneath her, grounding her body. She even noticed a hint of lavender scent from her candle on the shelf.

Emily continued to stay in the present moment, fully immersed in her mindfulness practice. She felt a sense of calmness and peace wash over her, as if all her worries had taken a backseat for a while. It was a refreshing break from the busyness of her day, and she knew she could always come back to this practice whenever she needed it.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Sarah put on her sneakers, stepped outside, and let the fresh air embrace her. As she walked, she felt the tension in her body gradually ease, and her mind began to clear.

After her walk, Sarah realized she was still feeling a bit triggered. That's when she remembered the second step: drink a big glass of water. She went to the kitchen, filled up a glass, and slowly sipped the water. It felt refreshing, and she noticed that her craving for unhealthy snacks started to fade away.

As Sarah continued her day, she encountered another trigger. This time, she recalled the third step: do a craft or hobby. She gathered her crochet supplies and started working on a colorful blanket. The rhythmic movements of her hands and the vibrant yarn helped her focus her mind and channel her energy into something positive.

Later that evening, Sarah found herself feeling lonely and craving comfort. Instead of reaching for food, she remembered the fourth step: call a friend. She picked up her phone and dialed her best friend's number. They talked for hours, sharing laughs and supporting each other. By the end of the call, Sarah felt uplifted and grateful for the connection she had.

Finally, Sarah realized the importance of the fifth step: keeping binge foods out of the house. She cleaned out her pantry, removing all the unhealthy snacks that tempted her during times of stress. By creating a supportive environment, she made it easier to resist the urge to binge eat.

Step 2: Set Reminders

- Set a reminder on your phone or use a calendar to mark the due date.
- Choose a time when you know you will have the necessary funds available.

Step 3: Save Money
- Create a savings plan to set aside the money needed for rent.
- If your rent is due on the 15th of each month, for example, start saving a little bit each week or month leading up to that date.
- Consider cutting back on unnecessary expenses or finding ways to earn extra money to help reach your rent goal.

Step 4: Paying the Rent
- On the designated day, gather the necessary funds to pay your rent.
- If you receive an allowance or have a part-time job, make sure to have the money ready.

Once upon a time, there was a sixth-grader named Alex who took on the responsibility of paying their own rent. Alex knew that paying rent on time was crucial to maintain a good relationship with their landlord and ensure a stable living situation.

To begin, Alex calculated the amount of rent due each month by looking at the lease agreement. They discovered that the total amount was $500. With this information in mind, Alex moved on to the next step.

Setting reminders became Alex's next task. They decided to pay their rent on the 1st of every month. Using their phone, Alex set a reminder for the due date, ensuring they wouldn't forget. They also made sure to set the reminder at a time when they knew they would have the necessary funds available.

To ensure they had enough money for rent, Alex created a savings plan. They started saving $125 each week, so by the time the 1st of the month came around, they would have the full amount saved up. Alex made a few sacrifices, like cutting back on buying snacks during school, to reach their goal.

When the 1st of the month finally arrived, Alex gathered the $500 they had saved. They made sure to have the money in cash to pay their landlord directly. If they didn't have the full amount, Alex would have asked their parent for help or discussed alternative options with the landlord.

practice sports drills 45 minutes a day,,"Executive Functioning Skills,Declining physical health",,,"Steps:
Step 1: Choose a sport and set up a practice area
- Decide on a sport that you enjoy and want to improve in, such as basketball, soccer, or tennis.
- Find a suitable practice area, like a backyard, driveway, or a nearby park.

Step 2: Warm up and stretch
- Begin your practice session by warming up your body to prevent injuries. You can jog in place, do jumping jacks, or skip rope for a few minutes.
- After warming up, stretch your muscles gently. Focus on stretching your legs, arms, and any other areas that will be used during your chosen sport.

Step 3: Practice fundamental skills
- Start by practicing the basic skills required for your sport. For example, if you're playing basketball, work on dribbling, shooting, and passing.
- Break down each skill into smaller parts and practice them individually. For instance, practice dribbling with your right hand, then with your left hand, and eventually try dribbling between your legs or behind your back.

Step 4: Set specific goals and challenges
- Set specific goals for each practice session to keep yourself motivated and focused. For instance, aim to make 10 free throws in a row or complete 20 successful passes without any mistakes.
- Create challenges for yourself to make the practice session more engaging. For example, challenge yourself to dribble around cones or set up targets to aim at while shooting.

Step 5: Cool down and reflect
- After practicing for 45 minutes, it's important to cool down your body. Slowly walk or jog for a few minutes to bring your heart rate back to normal.
- Take a moment to reflect on your practice session. Think about what went well and what areas you can improve on next time. Celebrate your achievements and set new goals for the next practice session.

Example:
Meet Sarah, a sixth-grader who loves playing soccer. She sets up a small soccer field in her backyard using cones as goals. She starts her practice session by warming up her body with some jogging in place and stretching her legs and arms. 

Next, Sarah focuses on the fundamental skills of soccer. She starts by practicing dribbling the ball with her right foot, making sure to keep the ball close to her and maintaining control. Once she feels confident with her right foot, she switches to her left foot, challenging herself to dribble smoothly and accurately. 

After mastering dribbling, Sarah moves on to shooting. She sets up a target using a hula hoop and tries to score as many goals as possible. She sets a goal to score at least five goals in a row before moving on to the next skill. 

As her 45-minute practice session comes to an end, Sarah takes a few minutes to cool down by walking around her backyard, catching her breath. She then reflects on her practice session, realizing that her dribbling has improved, but she needs to work on her shooting accuracy. She sets a new goal to practice shooting from different angles in her next session. Sarah feels proud of her progress and looks forward to her next practice session.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

She imagines raising her hand in class, helping a friend at the park, and showing gratitude to her friend's parents when visiting their house. Emily feels confident that she has refreshed her memory on expected behavior and is ready to apply these behaviors when she goes out.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Step 2: Create a visual reminder. Use a calendar or a daily schedule to mark the designated screen time periods. Hang it in a visible place, like on your bedroom wall or refrigerator, so that you can easily see and remember when it's time to use screens.

Step 3: Use a timer. Set a timer for the designated screen time period. This will help you keep track of how much time you have left and remind you when it's time to stop using screens. You can use a timer on your phone, a kitchen timer, or a timer app on a tablet or computer.

Step 4: Engage in other activities. When it's not designated screen time, find other activities to do that don't involve screens. This could be reading a book, playing outside, doing a puzzle, drawing, or spending time with friends or family. Engaging in different activities will help you have a well-rounded day and reduce excessive screen time.

Step 5: Reflect and adjust. At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on how well you followed the designated screen time schedule. Did you stick to the times you set? Were you able to engage in other activities without feeling too tempted to use screens? If needed, make adjustments to your schedule for the next day to ensure a better balance.

Step 2: Plan the Details
Once you have decided on a tradition, it's time to plan the details. Determine when and where you will carry out the tradition. Consider if there are any specific materials or preparations needed. Make a list of everything you will need and discuss it with your family or friends.

Step 3: Get Everyone Involved
To make the tradition enjoyable for everyone, it's important to get everyone involved. Share the details of the tradition with your family or friends and invite them to participate. Encourage them to contribute their ideas and suggestions to make the tradition even better.

Step 4: Execute the Tradition
On the designated day and time, gather your family or friends and start the new tradition. Follow the plan you made in Step 2 and engage in the activity together. Remember to have fun, be present in the moment, and enjoy the experience with your loved ones.

Step 5: Reflect and Continue
After completing the new tradition, take some time to reflect on the experience. Discuss with your family or friends what you liked about the tradition and if there are any improvements you can make for the future. If the tradition was enjoyable, make a commitment to continue it annually or on a regular basis.

Example:
Once upon a time, there was a sixth-grader named Emily who wanted to start a new tradition with her family. She spent some time thinking about different ideas and finally settled on a tradition of having a monthly game night. Emily loved playing board games and thought it would be a great way to spend quality time with her family.

Excited about her idea, Emily gathered her family around the dining table to discuss the details. They decided that game night would be held on the first Saturday of every month, and they would take turns choosing the game to play. Emily's mom suggested creating a game night jar where they could write down game suggestions and randomly select one each month.

With the plan in place, Emily invited her family to join her in this new tradition. Her younger brother, Alex, was thrilled and immediately started thinking about which game he would choose first. Her parents were happy to have a dedicated time to bond as a family and agreed to participate wholeheartedly.

On the first Saturday of the following month, game night arrived. Emily set up the game night jar on the table, filled with slips of paper containing various game options. With anticipation in the air, they took turns picking a slip and playing the chosen game. They laughed, strategized, and enjoyed each other's company throughout the evening.

As the night came to an end, Emily's family gathered to reflect on their first game night. They all agreed that it was a fantastic experience and couldn't wait for the next one. They decided to keep the tradition going and make it a monthly event they could all look forward to.

And so, game night became a cherished tradition for Emily and her family. Every month, they continued to gather around the table, explore new games, and create lasting memories together.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing
Start a shopping wish list to stop impulse shopping.,,Debt,,,"Steps:
Step 1: Find a notebook or a piece of paper to use as your shopping wish list.

Step 2: Whenever you see something you want to buy, instead of buying it right away, write it down on your shopping wish list. Include the name of the item, its price (if you know it), and why you want it.

Step 3: Before adding an item to your shopping wish list, take a moment to think about whether you really need it or if it's just something you want in the moment. Ask yourself if buying this item will truly make you happy in the long run.

Step 4: Keep your shopping wish list with you at all times, either in your backpack or on your phone. Whenever you feel the urge to make an impulse purchase, take out your list and review it. Remind yourself of the reasons why you added those items to the list and whether they align with your long-term goals.

Step 5: Periodically review your shopping wish list, maybe once a week or once a month. Reflect on the items you added and decide if you still want them. You may find that some items have lost their appeal over time, and you can remove them from the list. On the other hand, if there are items you still genuinely want, you can start planning for them and saving money to make intentional purchases.

Example:
Meet Sarah, a sixth-grader who loves shopping and often finds herself making impulse purchases. One day, Sarah's mom told her about the idea of starting a shopping wish list to help her make better choices. Intrigued, Sarah decided to give it a try.

Step 1: Sarah rummaged through her desk drawers and found a small notebook that she could use as her shopping wish list. She liked the idea of having a physical list she could carry around.

Step 2: As Sarah went about her day, she encountered many tempting items she wanted to buy. Instead of giving in to the urge to buy them right away, she whipped out her notebook and carefully wrote down each item. For example, when she passed by a toy store and saw a new LEGO set, she added ""LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon - $79.99"" to her list, along with the reason ""because I love building LEGO and Star Wars is my favorite movie.""

Step 3: Sarah quickly realized that not every item she wanted to buy was something she truly needed. So, before adding anything to her list, she would pause and think about whether it was a genuine desire or just a fleeting impulse. For instance, when she saw a trendy backpack at the mall, she asked herself, ""Will this backpack still be cool to me in a month? Or am I just getting it because everyone else has it?"" This reflection helped her make wiser choices.

Step 4: Sarah made it a habit to keep her shopping wish list in her backpack, so it was always within reach. Whenever she felt the urge to buy something impulsively, she would take out her list and remind herself of the items she had already written down. One day, she found herself in a bookstore, eyeing a new book. But after glancing at her list, she remembered that she already had several unread books at home. That reminder helped her resist the impulse and saved her money.

Step 5: Every Sunday evening, Sarah would sit down with her shopping wish list and review it. Some items on the list no longer excited her as much, so she happily crossed them off. However, there were a few items, like the LEGO set, that she still genuinely wanted. Seeing those items on her list motivated her to start saving her allowance, knowing that she could make intentional purchases in the future.

By following these steps and maintaining her shopping wish list, Sarah became more mindful of her shopping habits and learned to make smarter purchasing decisions.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

As he closed his eyes, he pictured himself in a peaceful garden, surrounded by colorful flowers and a gentle breeze. Slowly, he released his breath and let go of the tension in his body. Alex reminded himself that getting angry wouldn't solve the problem and that staying calm was the better choice. He decided to take a short walk around the playground to clear his mind and regain his composure. As he walked, he noticed the chirping of birds and the warmth of the sun on his skin, which helped him feel more relaxed. By the time recess was over, Alex felt much calmer and was able to handle the situation calmly and assertively. He realized that using a calming strategy instead of acting out in anger had made a positive difference in resolving conflicts and maintaining healthy relationships.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

"use words, not actions, when my sibling or friend is bothering me",,Communications,,,"Steps:
Step 1: Take a deep breath and remain calm
- When your sibling or friend is bothering you, the first step is to take a deep breath and try to remain calm. This will help you think clearly and respond in a more controlled manner.

Step 2: Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings
- Instead of using blame or accusations, use ""I"" statements to express how their behavior is making you feel. For example, say ""I feel upset when you keep interrupting me"" instead of ""You always interrupt me!""

Step 3: Assertively ask for what you need
- Clearly and politely ask your sibling or friend for what you need in the situation. For instance, say ""I would appreciate it if you could give me some space right now"" or ""Could you please stop teasing me?""

Step 4: Suggest an alternative activity or solution
- Offer a suggestion or propose an alternative activity that both of you can engage in without bothering each other. This helps redirect the focus and find a more positive way to interact. For example, say ""Let's play a board game together instead"" or ""How about we take turns sharing our stories?""

Step 5: Seek help from a trusted adult if needed
- If the bothering continues or escalates, it's important to seek help from a trusted adult such as a parent, teacher, or counselor. They can provide guidance and support in finding a resolution to the situation.

Example:
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who had a younger brother named Max. They loved spending time together, but sometimes Max would bother Lily when she was trying to read her favorite book. One day, as Lily was engrossed in her story, Max kept poking her and demanding attention.

Lily remembered her steps to handle this situation and took a deep breath to stay calm. She then used an ""I"" statement to express her feelings, saying, ""I feel frustrated when you keep interrupting me while I'm reading."" Max seemed surprised and stopped poking her.

Feeling more empowered, Lily assertively asked Max for what she needed, saying, ""I would appreciate it if you could give me some quiet time to finish my book."" Max nodded and agreed to give her space.

Not wanting to leave Max feeling left out, Lily suggested they play a game together after she finished reading. She proposed playing a board game, which excited Max, and they both enjoyed spending time together without bothering each other.

If Max continued to bother her despite her efforts, Lily knew she could seek help from their mom or dad to find a solution that would work for both of them. But for now, Lily was happy that she had successfully used words instead of actions to handle the situation and maintain a positive relationship with her brother.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing

Step 2: Wear a Pedometer or Use a Step-Counting App
Get a pedometer or download a step-counting app on your smartphone. This will help you track the number of steps you take throughout the day. Make sure to have it with you wherever you go.

Step 3: Be Active Throughout the Day
Find opportunities to be active throughout your day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or bike to school if possible, and participate in physical activities during recess or after school. Look for ways to move more and sit less.

Step 4: Keep Track of Your Steps
Regularly check your pedometer or step-counting app to monitor your progress. Aim to reach your step goal by the end of the day. If you notice that you're falling short, try to find additional opportunities to be active.

Step 5: Celebrate Your Achievements
Celebrate each time you reach your step goal! This can be as simple as giving yourself a high-five, sharing your accomplishment with a friend or family member, or treating yourself to a small reward. Recognizing your efforts will motivate you to keep going.

She arrived at school and joined her friends during recess for a game of tag, adding more steps to her count.

During class, Lily remembered to stand up and stretch whenever possible, keeping her body active. At lunchtime, she opted to walk around the playground instead of sitting down, chatting with her friends as they walked together.

After school, Lily had soccer practice. She ran, kicked, and dribbled, accumulating even more steps. When she got home, she checked her step count and saw that she was just a few hundred steps away from her goal.

Determined to reach 10,000 steps, Lily decided to walk her dog around the neighborhood. As she strolled along, she enjoyed the fresh air and watched her step count slowly increase. Finally, she reached her goal, and a feeling of accomplishment washed over her.

Lily celebrated her achievement by doing a little happy dance right there on the sidewalk. She couldn't wait to tell her parents and friends about her success. With a big smile on her face, Lily felt motivated to continue her daily walking routine, knowing that each step was contributing to her overall well-being.",,,Caitlyn Wang,,Reviewing
