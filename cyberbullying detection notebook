ðŸ“Œ 1. Import Libraries

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

ðŸ”¹ These are standard tools for text classification.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Sample Dataset

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'text': [
        "You're so stupid",
        "I hope you have a great day!",
        "Nobody likes you",
        "You're amazing and strong",
        "Go kill yourself",
        "Stay positive and happy"
    ],
    'label': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 = cyberbullying, 0 = not
})

ðŸ”¹ A very basic dataset simulating cyberbullying (label 1) vs kind language (0).


---

ðŸ“Œ 3. Convert Text to Vectors

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data['text'])
y = data['label']

ðŸ”¹ Transforms text into numbers that the model can understand.


---

ðŸ“Œ 4. Train-Test Split + Model Training

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

ðŸ”¹ Splits data and trains a logistic regression model.


---

ðŸ“Œ 5. Evaluate the Model

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

ðŸ”¹ Shows precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate how good your model is.
